Getting Started: 

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

In terminal:

2.  Go to your main project directory (e.g. suli folder), then create a new module for the project (e.g. flask-http-assignment). Make sure to stay in this directory at all times during the project.

3. (Optional) Create and/or activate virtual environment based on your operating system.

4. Install required dependencies: flask and requests. 

5. The Flask server is already built and includes three endpoints (see app.py for code).

6. run your server with python app.py.

  API Overview 

1. First end point: uses the GET method to display a message. (how weather and stocks app works).

2. Second end point: uses the POST method to echo a JSON (how apps like Instagram work).

3. Third end point: uses the GET method along with a route to interact with the flask which sends a request to the server.
